# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Python implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player plays against the computer. The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, with the player using "O" and the computer using "X". The player and the computer take turns to make moves until there is a winner or a tie.
