# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Python implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player plays against the computer. The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, with the player using "O" and the computer using "X". The player and the computer take turns to make moves until there is a winner or a tie.
# Features
Player vs Computer: The player and computer take turns making moves.
Dynamic Move Management: The list of available moves updates automatically after each turn.
Board Display: The current board state is displayed after each move.
Victory Check: The game checks if the player or the computer has won after each move.
Tie Check: The game detects a tie if all moves are made and no one wins.
# How It Works
The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid where each cell is represented by a number (1-9).
The player is prompted to input their move by choosing a number corresponding to a free spot on the board.
The computer automatically chooses a free spot and places its "X".
After each move, the board is displayed, and the game checks if either player has won or if it's a tie.
The game continues until one player wins or the board is filled with no winner.
